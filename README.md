# TokenizedCourseRewards

## Description
TokenizedCourseRewards is a smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain to incentivize students with token rewards upon course completion. It allows students to enroll in a course and receive tokenized rewards from an admin once they successfully complete it.

## Vision of the Project
The vision of this project is to create a decentralized and transparent system for rewarding students who complete online courses. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to:
- Provide tamper-proof course completion verification.
- Encourage continuous learning through financial incentives.
- Enable institutions to tokenize and distribute rewards seamlessly.

## Future Scope
- Integration with e-learning platforms to automate reward distribution.
- Support for multiple token types as rewards.
- Smart contract upgrades to allow customizable reward structures.
- Decentralized governance for course approvals and reward criteria.
- NFT-based certificates for completed courses.
